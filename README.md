# wow-timer
Python program that initializes/closes World of Warcraft and records time spent on it //

This project is entirely self taught, and I've planned it to go like this:
-Create a GUI for easy use of the program
-One button will launch WoW and start a timer
-The second button will close WoW and stop the timer
-On close, the recorded time will be input into some sort of table or excel sheet that auto calculates total time spent on the game
